# Simple Linear Regression for Predicting Exam Scores

## Project Overview:

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis to predict exam scores based on the number of study hours. It serves as a foundational example for implementing machine learning algorithms in Python, specifically using the scikit-learn library for linear regression.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains two columns: "Hours" and "Scores." It consists of 25 rows, with each row representing a student's study hours and their corresponding exam scores. The goal of the project is to build a linear regression model to predict scores based on study hours.

## Results

The linear regression model successfully predicts exam scores based on the number of study hours, achieving an accuracy of approximately 94.55%. The mean absolute error is calculated as 4.18, indicating a good working model.

Additionally, the model predicts that if a student studies for 9.25 hours per day, the expected score would be approximately 93.69.
